# Psuedo Arclength Continuation

An implementation of an arclength continuation algorithm to find the neutral curve for the Blasius Boundary layer.
The code follows ideas from https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(84)90032-9

Run the code continuation.m

A write up for people who have used an old version of the code is provided and may be of some use.
I hope to tidy things up in the future and improve the documentation.
